## Motivation
The motivation behind this product was because I wanted to learn JavaScript and HTML. I decided to make something that would be useful to people and after polling a lot of people wanted a quick and easy way to calculate their GPA. This is my first Chrome Extension and JavaScipt/HTML project.
